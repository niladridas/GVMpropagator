%  Precession-nutation, IAU 2006/2000A models:  a multi-purpose function,
%  supporting classical (equinox-based) use directly and CIO-based use
%  indirectly.
%
%  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
%  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
%
%  Status:  support function.
%
%  Given:
%     date1,date2            TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
%
%  Returned:
%     dpsi,deps              nutation (Note 2)
%     epsa                   mean obliquity (Note 3)
%     rb                     frame bias matrix (Note 4)
%     rp                     precession matrix (Note 5)
%     rbp                    bias-precession matrix (Note 6)
%     rn                     nutation matrix (Note 7)
%     rbpn                   GCRS-to-true matrix (Notes 8,9)
%
%  Notes:
%  1)  The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
%      convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
%      JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
%      among others:
%
%             date1          date2
%
%          2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
%          2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
%          2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
%          2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
%
%      The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
%      cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
%      is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
%      the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
%      optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
%      are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
%
%  2)  The nutation components (luni-solar + planetary, IAU 2000A) in
%      longitude and obliquity are in radians and with respect to the
%      equinox and ecliptic of date.  Free core nutation is omitted;
%      for the utmost accuracy, use the iauPn06 function, where the
%      nutation components are caller-specified.
%
%  3)  The mean obliquity is consistent with the IAU 2006 precession.
%
%  4)  The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
%      applying frame bias.
%
%  5)  The matrix rp transforms vectors from mean J2000.0 to mean of
%      date by applying precession.
%
%  6)  The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean of date by
%      applying frame bias then precession.  It is the product rp x rb.
%
%  7)  The matrix rn transforms vectors from mean of date to true of
%      date by applying the nutation (luni-solar + planetary).
%
%  8)  The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true of date
%      (CIP/equinox).  It is the product rn x rbp, applying frame bias,
%      precession and nutation in that order.
%
%  9)  The X,Y,Z coordinates of the IAU 2006/2000A Celestial
%      Intermediate Pole are elements (1,1-3) of the matrix rbpn.
%
%  10) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
%      arguments.  The arrays are filled in the stated order.
